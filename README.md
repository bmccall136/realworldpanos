# RealWorldPANOS

**Real-world PAN-OS field notes from production environments.**  
Practical lessons, patterns, and defensive techniques—written by a working firewall engineer.

---

## What you’ll find here

- **Proxy / bypass reality** (what actually shows up in logs)
- **App-ID + URL + behavior** patterns that matter in production
- **Panorama at scale**: hygiene, structure, and survivability
- **Decryption edge cases**: what breaks, why, and how to reduce pain
- **Operational tradeoffs**: performance, false positives, and maintainability

---

## Philosophy

- **No vendor spin. No fluff.**
- Share **how to think**, not copy/paste production configs.
- Examples are **sanitized** and designed to be adaptable across environments.

---

## Start here

- **Coming next:** *How users actually bypass web filtering (and why App-ID alone isn’t enough)*  
- **After that:** *Proxy-evasion indicators worth alerting on (without nuking legit traffic)*  
- **Then:** *Panorama structure that scales without turning into spaghetti*

## About

I’m a senior PAN-OS firewall engineer working in large-scale production networks, primarily in K-12 environments where bypass attempts are constant and creative.  
This site is a place to document what works, what fails, and why—so other engineers can move faster.
