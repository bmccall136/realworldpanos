    <h1>Connectivity Beyond the Campus</h1>

    <p>
      Large networks rarely start as sweeping designs. They usually begin with a single problem that refuses to stay isolated.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Greenville County Schools, that problem surfaced when every student received a Chromebook. Learning quickly became
      device-agnostic and location-agnostic, but connectivity did not. Over time, that challenge expanded beyond students and
      into transportation, public access, and eventually site resiliency.
    </p>

    <p>
      What followed was not a single project, but a reusable architecture. Secure cellular connectivity was extended to buses,
      public locations, and school sites without decentralizing security or creating special-case rules. Each deployment reused
      the same core principles, allowing the network to grow without being reinvented.

      What ties these deployments together is not hardware or transport, but architectural discipline. Centralized enforcement,
      clear segmentation, and designs that anticipated growth made it possible to extend connectivity without compromising
      security or operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      These lessons were learned through years of real-world deployment and scale.
