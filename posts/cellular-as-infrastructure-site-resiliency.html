    <h1>Cellular as Infrastructure for Site Resiliency</h1>

    <p>
      As the environment matured, cellular connectivity was extended again, this time to support site resiliency rather than
      user access.
    </p>

    <p>
      School locations were equipped with cellular paths designed specifically for failover. These deployments provided no
      wireless access and were not intended for general internet use. Their sole purpose was to maintain continuity when
      primary circuits were unavailable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under normal conditions, sites operated entirely on primary connectivity. When outages occurred, routing behavior shifted
      automatically, allowing priority services such as voice and critical applications to continue operating across secure
      cellular tunnels back to core firewalls. When primary connectivity returned, traffic reverted without manual
      intervention.
    </p>

  <p>
      From an operational standpoint, this reduced the noise typically associated with site outages. From a user standpoint,
      many failures went unnoticed. Cellular connectivity had transitioned from an emergency workaround into infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
      By this stage, scale made automation and centralized management mandatory rather than optional. The same architectural
      discipline that made earlier deployments successful ensured that resiliency could be added without complexity.
